# Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction

Upon thorough analysis and modeling, we've excavated the main influencing factors that determine whether passengers will refer the airline to others. Through techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing, we've prepared the dataset for model building. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we've trained models to predict passenger referrals with considerable accuracy.

The insights gained from feature importance analysis shed light on the critical aspects of airline services that significantly impact passenger recommendations. By understanding these key factors, airlines can tailor their services to meet customer expectations, thereby improving overall satisfaction and increasing the likelihood of referrals.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the importance of predictive analytics in enhancing airline services and gaining a competitive edge in the aviation industry. By leveraging data-driven insights, airlines can make informed decisions to improve customer experiences, foster loyalty, and drive business growth in an increasingly competitive market.
